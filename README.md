# Let's try to do a VueJs app :)

## Out of scope for this project

- [x] Backend

## Very light SPA in VueJs. What we expect ?

- [ ] The possibility to create an account

- [ ] The possibility to log in / log off

- [ ] As user, I want to be able to customize my space (custom colors, availability to move (drag) some widgets in other place ...)

- [ ] Retrieving my user space at log in, like it was when we log out

## What should this app look like ?

This part is free. However some elements must be able to be moved, modified, ect... As said before, these modified elements will have to be in the same state if we reconnect.

Keep it simple as possible, it is not your design skills that are tested but more your capability to write clean and well designed code with best practice in a modern front-end framework. Obviously, it could be nice designed too ðŸ˜„.

## What about backend ?

Just simulate with your favorite tool, example [MirageJs](https://miragejs.com/docs/getting-started/introduction/)

## How to submit ?

To introduce your project, please start by forking this repo and submit a pull request when you think it is OK.

Please do not forget to write a README other than the one writing by your tools and add it any information you feel is relevant.

## Need extra information ? Questions about the project ? ...
